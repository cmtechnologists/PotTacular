# Project idea
The idea for the PotTacular App stemmed from a need for a better method to report potholes.
In our area, potholes develop frequently after the winter months, and the only reporting 
method available to the public is to send an email to the county. CMTechnologists have set 
out to solve this issue by creating a web app with the capability for public users to report
potholes easily and accurately. The app will use GPS location to submit coordinates, and 
will provide ease of use to drivers and walkers with one touch reporting for driving and 
more detailed reporting options for those who aren't behind the wheel. This will increase 
communication between users and the County to more adequately solve the current and ongoing 
road condition issues due to potholes.
